1;51 % attack;51% attacks occurs when a hacker gains control of over 50% of a blockchains hashing power;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667295221000386
2;Fork problems;Forking attacks occurs when a hacker replaces the most trusted chain by launching an alternative chain to gain benefits;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045790620307497
3;Scaling;The ability to handle and support the increasing volume of transactions, as well as an increasing number of participating nodes in the network;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-020-09368-6
4;Selfish mining;Is when a miner or a group of miners solves a hash, opens a new block and then withholds it from the public blockchain. This creates a fork, which is then mined to get ahead of the public blockchain;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667295221000386

The system gets vulnerable to attacks due to disruptive consensus within the network. ;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8934243
6;Consensus delay;Delay in the consensus due to other types of attacks. ETC. Majority attack. This is basically a consequence of attacks on the consensus;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9019870
7;Orphaned blocks;A block whose parent blocks hash field points to an unauthentic block that is detached from the Blockchain. These inconsistencies can be introduced by an attacker or caused by race conditions in the work of the miners.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9019870

The inconsistency not only shortens the extension speed of the main chain by honest miners, but also induces the attacks which have a detrimental impact on the security of the blockchain. Although the public ledger may appear diverse temporarily, it will finally achieve the consistent state by consensus mechanism for all nodes to share the accordant view of the blockchain;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-020-09368-6
